# TASK: Create a function who takes a name as a parameter, and
# says hello to the given user

# A function in Python is used to bundle a set of instructions that
# you want to use repeatedly, and called when needed.
# In Python, 'def' introduces a function definition. It must be followed
# by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters.
# The statements that form the body of the function start at the next
# line, and must be indented.


# Defining a function which says hello to the user.
def hello_python(name):
    print("Hello Python!", name, "this side")


hello_python("Roshan")
